    Care <br><br> We believe that care for people suffering with phagophobia, pseudodysphagia and any other type of phobias, is the best that you could provide for them. Showing your care for someone suffering from this condition might be a way of helping them express themselves well. As a result, they may be able to overcome what they are going through and lead a normal life.

  <p>
    Empathy <br> <br>Before judging people too quickly, try to put yourself in their shoes first. People living with Phagophobia or pseudodysphagia may often fall as victims of bullying or isolation. This may affect their recovery and also bring about more physical or mental impacts. The ability to understand what someone else is going through is key in helping your friend or family member overcome phagophobia and pseudodysphagia. Therefore, we believe in the power of compassion and empathy.
