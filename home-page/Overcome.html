    <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
    <img src="/assets/Diagnosis.jpeg" alt="" /><br /><br />
Phagophobia is recognized as a specific phobia in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).3 Specific phobias involve fear of a specific object or situation—in this case, swallowing—that's out of proportion with the real danger that's present. <br><br>

If you believe you may have phagophobia, your doctor will talk to you to determine if your symptoms have lasted at least six months and are extreme enough that they cause disruptions in other areas of your life, like in your relationships or career.<br><br>

Your doctor will also rule out other medical conditions that can lead to problems swallowing, like dry mouth, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), body dysmorphia, or globus hystericus, or the chronic feeling of having a lump in the throat.2 Your doctor may also look for signs of another mental health condition, such as:<br><br>

Eating disorder
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)
Panic disorder
Social anxiety disorder (SAD)

    <h3>Treatment</h3>

Phagophobia can lead to progressively more restricted eating habits and, in serious cases, significant health issues. However, specific phobias do respond to treatment, and several options have shown promise for treating phagophobia:4<br><br />

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): CBT helps you notice your negative thought patterns so you can challenge them and adopt different behaviors. CBT also teaches you ways to overcome distress, like distracting yourself, and may include psychoeducational aspects to help you understand phagophobia.<br /><br />
Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR): EMDR uses sensory stimuli, like repetitive eye movements or hand tapping, to reduce the distress you feel while swallowing.<br /><br />
Exposure therapy: Exposure therapy involves gradually exposing yourself to your fear with the help and support of your therapist, eventually working your way up to swallowing foods or drinks.<br /><br />
Hypnotherapy: In hypnotherapy, your therapist helps you enter a trance-like state, which allows to you focus more deeply on the root of your fear.<br /><br />
Medication: Certain medications may help reduce your anxiety levels during treatment. These may include antidepressants and beta-blockers.<br /><br />
Find a therapist who will work with you to develop a treatment plan that addresses your phagophobia and any related disorders. Developing a relationship with a mental health professional who comes to know you well can be very helpful, as your phagophobia treatment plan will need to be designed to meet your specific needs.<br /><br />

  <h3>
    Coping
  </h3>

  While professional help is beneficial for phagophobia, you can also use coping techniques to help you overcome distress on your own. Since the throat muscles often constrict during bouts of anxiety, coping strategies generally focus on remaining calm.<br><br>

Find distractions: Some people find that watching TV or listening to music while eating provides a welcome distraction that makes chewing and swallowing a less intense experience.<br><br>
Take small bites: Small bites or small sips of liquid may feel easier to swallow than larger portions. <br><br>
Chew food thoroughly: Chewing your food well makes it easier to swallow, which may help alleviate some of your anxiety.<br><br />
Eat soft foods: Soft foods may irritate your throat less than hard, scratchy foods will. Use trial and error to find the foods you're most comfortable with. <br /><br />
Drink liquids between bites: Taking a sip of liquid with each bite eases the swallowing process.<br /><br /><br />
