  <h1> Phagophobia and pseudodysphagia</h1>

  <p>
    There are three main things that help sustain the lives of people on earth. These three things are <ol>
      <li>food</li>
        <li>clothing</li>
          <li>shelter</li>
    </ol> <br>
    <div class="div2"><p class="ZeroO">They are henceforth considered the three basic needs for survival. Without food, life on earth would be impossible. Imagine living a life where you are not able to swallow food, drink water or take pills. Imagine having to take a number of deep breaths in order to gather up the courage to take a bite of the yummy pizza on your plate. This is the day to day life of a person suffering from phagophobia or pseudodysphagia. While the two of them have been brought about by fear, the difference between the two is the nature of the fear. While people suffering from pseudodysphagia have the fear of being choked by food, people suffering from phagophobia fear the act of swallowing the food. The two are often confused. These conditions are relatively rare and their impacts are mainly felt by those who suffer from it or those who live with people suffering from it. Whether you are a person who suffers from either phagophobia or pseudodysphagia, or you are just curious to know about these conditions, you are at the right place. Letâ€™s now dig into the topic and find out more about these rare conditions.

     What is phagophobia ?
     
   </h3>
   <p>
     Phagophobia is an eating disorder that involves the fear of swallowing. It is a form of psychogenic dysphagia that is not characterized by any physical problems in the swallowing organs. This means that people suffering from this condition do not have any form of diagnosis that prevents them from swallowing normally.

  <h3>
   What is pseudodysphagia ?
   </h3>
   <p>
     Just like phagophobia, pseudodysphagia is an eating disorder that prevents someone frome ating normally. Il involves an intense fear of chocking from food. Just like in lhagophobia, people suffering from pseudodysphagia show no physical abnormalities in the swallowing system. This makes pseudodysphagia a mental disorder. <br>

   <h3>
     Causes of phagophobia and pseudodysphagia
   </h3>
   <p>
     People suffering from phagophobia and pseudodysphagia obtain these conditions in different ways. Some people have obtained the condition after bad experiences with food. For instance, if someone was eating and then they get chocked from the food, the person may instantly develop a fear of swallowing because they think that history might repeat itself. Some people may develop the disease after watching someone else get choked by food. <br><br>
     With an interview with one of my classmates in high school, who at one point had suffered from pseudodysphagia, I learned that he had begun suffering from pseudodysphagia after being sick for a while. However, his condition was mistaken for a loss of appetite by his family. But soon after the impacts of the condition became vital, his family decided to take action and take him to hospital. He was later diagnosed with pseudodysphagia. <br><br>
     I have also suffered from this condition at some point in my life. I had an extreme fear of swallowing pills. I had never been choked by one nor had I seen anyone have a bad experience with it. The fear just developed in me naturally. However, the mention of medicine or pills around me always gave me a feeling of extreme anxiety. All of this occurred without any specific trigger that made me develop the fear of swallowing pills. <br><br>
     The conditions above may also be developed as a result of anxiety when swallowing food. In real sense, phagophobia and pseudodysphagia result in anxiety which in turns makes someone feel as though they have developed a huge lump in their throat that suddenly prevents them from swallowing. After some days, approximately 28 days, this behaviour forms part of their habit, making it hard for them to break.
